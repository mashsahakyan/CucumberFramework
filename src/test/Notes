Recap class 1

What is cucumber framework?
    it supports BDD where we use gherkin language

tags:
    Given
    When
    And
    Then
    Scenario
    Feature

Given - Precondition
When - Actions to be done
Then - Expected output / result
And - It is a supporting keyword that can be used with other keywords in a scenario

What is step definition?
    step definition is the code implemented for the steps mentioned in feature file

page object model design pattern

Test runner
    we use test runner to execute all features in multiple combinations

feature = we define the path of our feature file here
glue = we define the path of our steps here
dry run = when it is set ot true, it stops actual execution and scan all the steps
strict = true, it checks all the steps definition
monochrome = it removed all unreadable characters from the console output
tags = we can segragate scenarios based on tags and can execute them accordingly(like @smoke, @regression, @sprint#)


Class 3
=== Recap ===

Runner class
    this is the configuration file in cucumber framework from where we can execute our features.

@RunWith - junit
@CucumberOptions - feature, glue, dryRun, monochrome, strict, tags,

hooks - @Before - we use this to define our pre conditions
        @After - we use this to define our post conditions

what is the difference in between hooks and background?
    Background is feature file specific which will be limited to a feature
    Hooks are applicable for all the scenarios available in features

Data driven test

Class 4
=== Recap ===

Test runner:
    @RunWith
    @CucumberOptions
    features - path of our feature file
    glue - path of our steps package
    dryRun - if it is set to true it checks the definitions of steps if it is not implemented
    it gives us snippet to implement
    monochrome - to avoid/remove all unreadable characters from console output
    tags - to define/filter scenarios for execution we use tags
    strict -


Class 5
=== Recap ===

Datatable as list
    when we don't provide headers in the table

excel reading example for adding the employees
plugin
    pretty is responsible for printing all the steps in console
    html plugin generates cucumber.html report in target folder
takeScreenshot method
   we use Scenario in hooks that accepts array of bytes that
cucumber maven report
   it generates json report in target folder under cucumber-html-report


mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @test"
mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@test"
